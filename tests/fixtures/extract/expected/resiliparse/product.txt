BUILT FOR FPS GAMERS

The result is Xccurate Design: the extra-wide Ctrl key for fewer missed clicks and greater precision. The keyboard also comes with four silver-hued keycaps for easy identification of the WASD control group, and even includes a keycap-puller tool for easy customization.

READY FOR WORK OR PLAY

The Quick-Toggle Switch prepares ROG Strix Scope for gaming or the daily grind, toggling the top row between Media or Function (Fn) key input – so it"s easy to switch modes for work or play.
